## Introduce

Radar is an important sensor device for obtaining battlefield information, and battlefield situation simulation based on radar has important scientific significance and application value. This project is aimed at the background of multiple radars simultaneously tracking multiple batches of targets in the air in a large-scale battlefield environment. It focuses on the simulation of moving target trajectory in radar situation modeling and develops a radar target situation simulation demonstration software based on Python tools. The software system has the characteristics of reconfigurable target parameters, flexible configuration of radar parameters, high fidelity of plot data, real-time dynamic display, etc. And combined with radar data processing, it can achieve comprehensive evaluation design of situation simulation and information processing

## Use

```commandline
git glone https://github.com/syit-yx/Radar4S.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
```
Or download the [installation package](https://github.com/syit-yx/Radar4S/releases/tag/v1.4) in release to install it on your computer
